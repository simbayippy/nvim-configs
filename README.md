# nvim-configs

This repository contains my personal configuration files for my development workflow. Recently I realized the immediate benefits of an AI IDE such as Cursor, but could not replace the flows of nvim. Hence the configurations were ported over to Vscode/cursor settings.

The contents of this repo focuses on:

Under user settings

- Cursor IDE

under ~/.config/

- Neovim
- Yabai (window management for macOS)
- SKHD (hotkey daemon for macOS)

These configs are tailored to enhance productivity and streamline my development environment.

## Contents

- Cursor settings.json and keybindings.json the mimicks nvim configs
- Neovim configuration
- Yabai configuration
- SKHD keybindings

Feel free to explore and use any parts of these configs that you find useful for your own setup.
